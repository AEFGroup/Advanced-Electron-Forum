Also it is recommended if you have the GD library installed in PHP.


Installing Advanced Electron Forums :

After downloading AEF 1.0.9 from Anelectron.com unzip it on your computer.
You will now need to upload all the unzipped files to a directory on your server which supports PHP and MySQL.
Lets say you uploaded all your files to a folder forum on your server.
Once all the files are uploaded to your server open up your browser and visit the URL of that folder i.e. http://www.yourdomain.tld/forum/ - where www.yourdomain.tld/forum is the URL to where you uploaded it.
You will then see the AEF Install screen.
Just fill in the necessary details and your AEF Board will be installed in no time.


Upgrading Advanced Electron Forums :
